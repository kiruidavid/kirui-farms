# kirui-farms 

This is a simple Node project, it has Users and Farmers. 
The Farmer registers  and adds the crop they want to sell, with the number of bags and their price. 
A user then registers and searches for a crop with the number of bags they want and they will be connected with the farmer in the database with that crop.
